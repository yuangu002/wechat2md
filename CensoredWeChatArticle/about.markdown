This blog is a collection of WeChat Official Account articles which have high risk of being censored by either Tencent or the Cyberspace Administration of China. All WeChat articles are converted into Markdown files and organized in a Jekyll-style post layout. You can either fork this repo to maintain your own collection or open a PR/issue if you want it to be merged.

## Guideline
I will only accept articles that analyze facts, share information/knowledge, or present what is happening.<br>
I will **NOT** accept any politcally opinionated article.<br>
I will **certainly NOT** accept articles/resources which have not been originally posted on WeChat or the Internet within GFW.<br>

## Contributing
Any contribution is welcomed if it follows the above guideline.

### WeChat articles

### Other resources (video, picture, etc.)

### If you are not technical
Open an issue and post the article/resource you want to preserve.

## Disclaimer
I fully support the one-party leadership by the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Four Cardinal Principles. However, I am also a steadfast advocate for free access of information (**not freedom of speech**). All efforts in this repo by no means target against any specific political clique. As an engineer, I only provide **a persistent storage infrastructure** and **a centralized presentation**, with the help of GitHub and Jekyll, for information that has been notoriously/indiscriminately censored by the GFW. I do **NOT** necessarily support any point of view implicated by any article.

I am **NOT** interested in discussing politics on GitHub.
